## GANs
- The paper that introduced GANs: https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661
- GAN demo: https://github.com/Zackory/Keras-MNIST-GAN
- Tips and Tricks on Training GAN: https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks
- GAN Survey paper:  https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8195348

### Conditional Gans
- The paper that introduced conditional GANs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf
- Pics2pics paper (conditioning on an image/segmentation): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf
- The pic2pics competitor that gives each segmentation instance: https://tcwang0509.github.io/pix2pixHD/

### GAN manipulation: 
- Explores the latent space: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.03552.pdf
- GAN Dissection, look at the sublayers in the gan to control outputs: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10597.pdf
- Another latent space exploration: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJslDBkwG

### GAN state of the art : 
- "style transfer": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01365.pdf
- an earlier paper by the "style transfer" guys on improving resolution: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf
- going nuts on training: https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096
